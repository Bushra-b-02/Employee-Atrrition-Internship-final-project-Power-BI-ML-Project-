# Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction

This repository contains two integrated projects focused on **Employee Attrition**:

1. **Employee Attrition Dashboard (Power BI)**  
   - An interactive dashboard built in **Power BI** to visualize attrition insights, HR analytics, and workforce trends.  
   - Provides KPIs such as Total Employees, Attrition Count, Attrition %, Demographics, Job Roles, and Department-wise analysis.  
   - Supports drill-through for detailed insights.  

2. **Employee Attrition ML Model (Jupyter Notebook)**  
   - A machine learning pipeline developed in **Python** to predict the likelihood of employee attrition.  
   - Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.  
   - Uses popular ML libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn**.
